1. Write a PHP file to output "Have a good morning!" if the current time is less than 10,
and "Have a good day!" if the current time is less than 20. Otherwise it will output "Have
a good night!” using predefined function date("H") to get the current time.
2. Using “while” and “Do...While” loops to display “5,10,15,20,30,35,40”. Using
“foreach” and “Array Iterator”loop to display values of a five elements array
$programmingLanguagesArray = ["PHP", "C++", "C#", "Python", "Java"].
3. Create a form with post method to collect inputted hour, in action PHP page use
$_POST["hour"]to retrieve the hour value. Then output "Have a good morning!" if the
time is less than 10, and "Have a good day!" if the time is less than 18, and “Good
evening!” if the time is less than 23, Otherwise it will output "Switch off the computer!".
4. Create a form with post method to collect inputted integer, in action PHP page use
$_POST["num"]to retrieve the integer value. Using a loop numbered by the retrieved
integer value to display “Hello PHP!”, and the font size start from size 1 to the number
retrieved from the form.
5. Create a “header.php” file, and include it into the three files created by task 1, 2 and 3.1. Write a PHP file for this exercise, you will use a list of ten of the largest cities in the world. (Please note, these are not the ten largest, just a selection of ten from the largest cities.) Create an array with the following values: Tokyo, Mexico City, New York City, Mumbai, Seoul, Shanghai, Lagos, Buenos Aires, Cairo, London.
Print these values to the browser separated by commas, using a loop to iterate over the array. Sort the array, and then print the values to the browser in an ordered list, again using a loop.
Add the following cities to the array: Los Angeles, Calcutta, Osaka and Beijing. Sort the array again, and print it once more to the browser in an unordered list.

2. In this PHP exercise, you will again use the list of cities in task 1. Here's the list, this time including countries as well as cities:
Tokyo, Japan; Mexico City, Mexico; New York City, USA; Mumbai, India; Seoul, Korea; Shanghai, China; Lagos, Nigeria; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Cairo, Egypt; London, England. 
This time, create an associative array, using the countries as keys, the cities as values. Print the array once more to the browser in an unordered list returning the statement $city is in $country.
3. Save the lab6.1.txt file in your PHP development folder, write PHP to read all lines of this file and display them in browser; add all content from lab6.2.txt at the end of lab5.1.txt and display them again. 
4. Write a PHP function to generate a random password (contains uppercase, lowercase, numeric and other) using shuffle() function

5. $ceu = array( "Italy"=>"Rome", "Luxembourg"=>"Luxembourg", "Belgium"=> "Brussels", "Denmark"=>"Copenhagen", "Finland"=>"Helsinki", "France" => "Paris", "Slovakia"=>"Bratislava", "Slovenia"=>"Ljubljana", "Germany" => "Berlin", "Greece" => "Athens", "Ireland"=>"Dublin", "Netherlands"=>"Amsterdam", "Portugal"=>"Lisbon", "Spain"=>"Madrid", "Sweden"=>"Stockholm", "United Kingdom"=>"London", "Cyprus"=>"Nicosia", "Lithuania"=>"Vilnius", "Czech Republic"=>"Prague", "Estonia"=>"Tallin", "Hungary"=>"Budapest", "Latvia"=>"Riga", "Malta"=>"Valetta", "Austria" => "Vienna", "Poland"=>"Warsaw") ;

Create a PHP script which displays the capital and country name from the above array $ceu. Sort the list by the capital of the country.
